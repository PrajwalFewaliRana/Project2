# Project2

This is my second project which is also made by using vite + react with tailwind css.

This project is E-commerce website of shoes . I copied the design from dribble beacause i don't have that much knowledge about design
and if i start to do both design and code it only slows me down. In this project there are some animations while scrolling. I also made 
add to cart ,login , signup etc . This project is kind of simple but i failed to make it responsive because i am facing problem while
making it resposnsive . It may be beacaue i am newbie in this field and i am still learning .
